# Malware-Categorisation-Using-Machine-Learning
Final year project - A tool for assessing the viability of unsupervised machine learning algorithms and static analysis for the detection and categorisation of WIN32 malware.

This is an extremely simple example of how to use machine learning algorithms to detect and categorise malware. For the detection rate calculations it is assumed that test files are pre-pended with BEN for benign and MAL for malicious.
This tool is purely for research purposes and is not meant to be used for anything else. 
Full details can be found inside the dissertation in the docs folder.
